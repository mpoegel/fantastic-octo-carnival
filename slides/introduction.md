## Introduction

### Transportation Network Analysis
by Matt Poegel


## The Goal

**use centrality measures such as betweenness and closeness to identify population centers from
road networks and match them with the major cities**


### Data
Roads are undirected edges and road intersections are vertices.

* Minnesota (2,635 nodes): \

* Colorado (435,666 nodes): \

* Northeast United States (1,524,453 nodes): \

## Ground Truth Data
* City names plus longitude and latitude: \

* City populations for cities in every US state: \
  2015 US Census estimates

## The Big Picture

## Past Work

* Leskovec et al. used a similar data set of California along with many others in a large study of
community structure in large networks. \
[http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.1355](http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.1355)
* Michael T. Chang looked at urban street patterns in a study of the road networks of San
Francisco, CA and Oldenburg, Germany. \

## Expected Outcome
* Create a method for taking an unlabeled network and attaching semantic data to the nodes and
edges based on the graphâ€™s structure
* Results will be evaluated using the longitude and latitude data that accompanies each of the road
networks
    * Average absolute distance error metric
    * Logarithmic loss


## Progress

* Set up a project repository
* Located sources for population and location data 
* Wrote scripts to download data sets and build the ground truth file for Minnesota
